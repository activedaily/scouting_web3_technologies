_New/old_ *technologies* for the _new/old_ web:

=== hash function 
It's widely used for data verification and indexing in data storage and crypto protocols.

=== hash table
It's used as a quick data index, _O(1)_ overage search time (if no collisions). 

=== merkle tree
For small data blocks verification of the whole big one.

=== distributed hash table (DHT)
It's used for nodes search in distributed network.

=== symmetric encryption 
For data encryption and decryption by one key.

=== asymmetric encryption 
For data encryption by one key and decryption by another key, this key pair are linked.

=== digital signature 
It's  widely used for digital data authenticity and verification.

=== blockchain 
It's growing data (chain of blocks) consistency verification data structure and mechanism, sometimes in a specific context word _blockchain_ means distributed network or protocol not just only data structure.

=== direct acyclic graph (DAG)
Same as _blockchain_ but instead of chain of blocks direct acyclic graph is used.

=== distributed consensus protocol
It's a protocol to reach consensus of some state in distributed network of nodes without trust.

=== zero knowledge proof 
One party (prover) proves to another party (verifier) a knowledge of value x without revealing x (zero knowledge of x), only _proof_ of _something_ with no other information about that _something_.

=== smart_contract 
It's a technology for digital contract's execution in trust-less environment, smart_contract in simple case can be processed between two parties, or executed for many paries on top of distributed ledger (blockchain) network

=== tokenomic 
It's a digital economy system with custom rules of tokens _emission_, _transfers_, _exchange_, etc., tokens can be _minted_ independentely or linked to fiat money or other kind of assets. 

=== cryptocurrency 
It's a digital currency, usually implemented on top of distributed ledger (blockchain) network.

=== stablecoin 
Low volatility (stable) digital coin linked somehow to stable asset (fiat money, metall, etc. ).

=== defi 
Decentralized finance, decentralized financial applications

=== fintech 
Financial technologies applications and services
