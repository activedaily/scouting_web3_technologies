== distributed ledger technology (DLT)

_DLT_ is an umbrella term for _verifiable_, _traceable_ and _fault tolerant_ state transition distributed protocols (_L1_), _blockhain_ or _DAG_ is used for transaction log (_state transition_ log).

In basic variant each node stores _same copy_ of data (_ledger_), that's over redundant approach but this _over redundancy_ gives tolerance to failures and malicious attacks.
