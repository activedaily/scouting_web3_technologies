== distributed ledger technology (DLT)

_DLT_ is an umbrella term for distributed protocols (L1) technologies constructed on _blockhain_ / _DAG_ or some other _state transition_ and verification / protection approaches.

Each node stores same copy of data (_ledger_), that's over redundant but this over redundancy gives tolerance to failures and attacks (external and internal).
