== symmetric encryption

=== encryption
It's a process that encrypts a plain input to encrypted output.

=== decryption
It's a process that decrypts an encrypted input to plain output.

=== symmetric encryption (one key)
[%hardbreaks]
It's a symmetric if same key for _encryption_ and _decryption_ are used.

=== plain text
It's an alias to input, _plain_ means _unencrypted_.

=== key derivation function (KDF)
KDF generates encryption key based on secret and random input parameters (derivates key), usually KDFs are constructed on _cryptographic hash functions_.


Basic form of _symmetric encryption_ are constructed on bitwise xor operation (_encrypted_data_ = _plain text_ xor _key_), to perfection _key_ must be absolutely random, unique and size of _key_ must be not less than size of _plai_text_ (that hard to use in practice for big _plain text_).

More complex _symmetric_encryption_ algoritms are based on _bitmixers_ of input data and _key_.

Uniqness and randomness of keys are very important. There are many approaches how to generate keys more or less secure. Many vulnerabilities are reasons of bad key generation and management.

=== brute force attack
[%hardbreaks]
Attacker repeats different variants of _key_ to decrypt data and test results, some prior information of _key_ generation can be used to reduce number of variants. Modern hardware is able to perform above peta operations per second (>10^15). For example _bitcoin_ _hash rate_ is about exa hashes per second (10^18).
