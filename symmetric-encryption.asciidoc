== symmetric encryption

=== encryption
It's a process that encrypts a plain input to encrypted output.

=== decryption
It's a process that decrypts an encrypted input to plain output.

=== symmetric_encryption (one key)
[%hardbreaks]
It's a symmetric if same key for _encryption_ and _decryption_ are used.

=== plain text
It's an alias to input, _plain_ means _unencrypted_.

=== key derivation function (KDF)
KDF generates another key based on input key (derivates), KDFs are constructed on _cryptographic hash functions_.


Basic form of symmetric encryption are constructed on bitwise xor operation (_encrypted_data_ = _plain text_ xor _key_), _key_ must be random, unique and size of _key_ must be not less than size of _plai_text_ (that hard to use in practice for big _plain text_).

More complex _symmetric_encryption_ algoritms are based on bitmixers, such as _AES_.

Uniqness and randomness of keys are very important. There are many approaches how to generate keys more or less secure.

=== Brute force attack
[%hardbreaks]
Attacker repeats different variants of _key_ to decrypt data, some prior information of _key_ generation can be used to reduce number of variants.
