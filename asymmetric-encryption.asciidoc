== asymmetric encryption
[%hardbreaks]

It's an _encryption_ with one _key_ and _decryption_ with another _key_. One _key_ _encrypts_, second _key_ _decrypts_, _decryption_ _key_ is linked with _encryption_ key.

=== public key cryptography
[%hardbreaks]
It's an _asymmetric encryption_ protocol, when participants generates key pairs: _private_, _public_ keys. _Public key_ is public and used to encrypt _messages_. _Private_ key is secret and used to decrypt messages. One party can send an encrypted by _public key_ a message to another party. Message is decrypted by _secret_ _key_.

Trusted 3d party is required to provide _certificates_ for _public keys_.

_RSA_ (_Rivest–Shamir–Adleman_) one of the first public key protocols is still widely used.

=== public key infrastructure (PKI)
Trusted 3d parties provide proofs (_certificates_) for _public keys_.

=== distributed public key infrastructure (DPKI)
_Distributed ledger/blockchain_ network can be used for _public keys_ infrastructure.

=== encrypted channel
[%hardbreaks]
Encrypted channel protocol can be constructed on _public key cryptography_ for encryption key exchange and _symmetric encryption_ for data encryption.

=== digital signatures
Public key cryptography is a foundation for digital signatures. Digital signature can be constructed as encrypted by _secret key_ message hash, to _verify_ encrypted message hash is decrypted by _public key_ and compared with actual message hash, if result is equal signature is correct.


=== brute force attack
[%hardbreaks]
Attacker repeats different variants of _secret key_ to produce _public key_, some prior information of _key_ generation can be used to reduce number of variants.
