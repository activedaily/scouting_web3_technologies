== distributed consensus protocols
It's simply consensus on state transition in distributed network without trust. State transition is processed by ordered list of _transactions_.

Technically to achieve consensus on state transition each node should send _digitally signed_ messages to other nodes. To reduce number of messages one coordinator (block producer) node can be used.

=== byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)
Tolerance to malicious minority of participants.

=== proof of work (POW)
It's a _block producer_ selection mechanism. Proof of that computationally hard problem is solved (_POW_) is used to select a _block producer_ node who provides state transition by one block, for another block - another block producer is selected.

=== proof of stake (POS)
Same as _POW_ but different selection mechanism among nodes with staked balance is used, bigger stake - bigger chanses to be selected.

Block producers are incentivized by reward.
